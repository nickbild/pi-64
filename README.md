# Pi64

The Pi64 is a Raspberry Pi 400 that has been coerced into booting into a Commodore 64-like text mode.

I *love* the retro vibes that the Raspberry Pi 400 gives off.  The all-in-one computer-in-a-keyboard design makes me feel like I'm working with a computer from my childhood.  The only problem I have is that when I look up from the keyboard, it's just another modern(-ish) computer running Linux.  I set out to fix that with the Pi64.

Inspired by the Commodore 64, the Pi64 boots into a C64-themed bash shell in text mode.  No X Server is involved.  It is not a C64 emulator, it is Raspberry Pi OS, so you can get real work done, it just extends the Pi 400's retro feel to the screen.
